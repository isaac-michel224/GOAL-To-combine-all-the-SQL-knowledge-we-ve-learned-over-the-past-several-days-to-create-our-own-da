GOAL:
To combine all the SQL knowledge we've learned over the past several days to create our own database, create and customize tables, insert and update records, and create relationships between tables. You should be comfortable using the following SQL commands during this project:

CREATE TABLE
SELECT
INSERT INTO
UPDATE
JOIN (both LEFT and INNER)
DELETE
BEGIN TRANSACTION and ROLLBACK
DESCRIPTION: 
Create your own database on https://sqliteonline.com! 

REQUIREMENTS:
Have at least three tables with at least one relationship to another table for each
Have one table with at least 25 records and at least 10 records in the others (there is no max limit!)
Two tables should have at least five columns (including the primary key column)
Show off using the following commands by using the File->Save SQL function 
Write an INSERT INTO command that adds multiple records at the same time 
Write a JOIN that displays a view with at least 5 columns from two different tables
Write a JOIN that displays a view with at least 7 columns from three (or more) different tables
Write an ALTER TABLE command to add a new column to your table
We didn't cover this command in class! Read about it on W3Schools here: https://www.w3schools.com/SQL/sql_alter.asp
SUBMISSION: 
Use the Save DB and Save SQL function on sqliteonline.com to download your database at the end and each of the SQL commands outlined above under "Requirements".
Submit each file below or push them to a GitHub repo and submit the URL. 

EXAMPLE IDEAS:
